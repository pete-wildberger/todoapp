# Weekend Challenge 3 #

My 'to do' App creates a list of colorful boxes sorted by date.  While in the 'To Do' field, you can click on one of two button that appear when you hover over a box.  The check button sends the item to the completed list and the X deletes the item from the page and the database.  When you click on an 'X' button you will be prompted to confirm that you really want to delete the item.

I used express.router to make my server.js page look a little cleaner.

I'm not super happy with the style of the page. I dabbled in some CSS that I'm am not very familiar with with mixed results. It's not pretty but it works.  My app was inspired by Google Keep but I think the only thing I successfully replicated was the colorful boxes.
